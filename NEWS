# CHANGES TO RPublica 0.1.2 #

## SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

* The package now uses httr::GET for HTTP requests and jsonlite instead of RJSONIO for response conversion.
* Support for XML-formatted responses is removed, for simplicity.
* Responses should now return "flatter" data structures, often dataframes or lists containing dataframes in an effort to ease data transformation (h/t Jeroen Ooms)
